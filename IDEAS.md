3. Cross-promote between initiatives
4. Begin with 1-2 initiatives that align best with current skills
5. Reinvest time (not money) as traction develops

## Next Steps
- Evaluate which ideas align best with current skills and interests
- Research audience needs and competition in the most promising areas
- Develop a content calendar or development roadmap for the selected initiative(s)
- Identify key metrics to track progress and success
